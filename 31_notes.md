# javascript and classes
- Do javascript have classes?
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015
specification (often referred to as ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is
primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over
existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar
syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under
hood it works somewhat differently.
